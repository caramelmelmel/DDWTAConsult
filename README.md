## Guidelines 
1. I really don't appreciate telegram pm. We are busy as it is already.
2. Piazza went onto paid mode. Such a nice platform actually allows you to be anonymous and not be afraid to ask.
3. Use this platform so that people can ask me questions that are organised in tabs. 

## Asking via issue
1. There are many templates. Click on the one that appeals to your questions or question the most. 
2. Under the labels tab on the right hand side, if the question pertains to a specific week's concept, add the label for the specific week. 
3. Do not remove the labels attached to the individual templates provided. 
4. Don't ask me what is tested or what is not tested for a specific exam! I'm not a prof You can only ask me questions pertaining to how it can help you in the exam
